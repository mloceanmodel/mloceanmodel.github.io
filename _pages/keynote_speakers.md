  <div>

	<b>Dr. Peter Lean</b> is a Senior Scientist at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), where he contributes to the development of innovative machine learning approaches for weather prediction. He is a key member of the team working on the Artificial Intelligence–Direct Observation Prediction (AI–DOP) project, which aims to generate skilful weather forecasts directly from observational data without relying on traditional physics-based models. 
<br>
<br>
In his keynote talk, Dr. Lean will share insights from the AI–DOP project, discussing the challenges and successes of applying observation-driven machine learning techniques to atmospheric forecasting. He will also explore the potential for extending these methods to ocean prediction, addressing the unique challenges posed by the ocean environment, such as sparse observational data and longer timescales. His experience offers valuable perspectives on the future integration of AI in Earth system modelling.
